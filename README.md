# My_Portfolio
My own portfolio website!  I built it using: ✅ HTML (for structure) ✅ CSS  ✅ A touch of JavaScript for interactivity  Honest Moment: I took some help from YouTube tutorials along the way, but I made sure to understand every concept I implemented. Learned a ton  Next time, I’ll challenge myself to build it 100% from scratch
